<template name="ComponentButtonFullWidth">
    <h2 class="header">Full Width Block Buttons</h2>

    <p>
        Adding <code>button-full</code> to a button not only applies
        <code>display: block</code>, but also removes borders on the left and
        right, and any border-radius which may be applied. This style is useful
        when the button should stretch across the entire width of the display.
        Additionally, the button's parent element does not have <a>padding</a>
        applied.
