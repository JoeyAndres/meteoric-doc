<template name="ComponentButtonBlock">
    <h5>Block Buttons</h5>
    <p>
        Adding <a>button-block</a> to a button applies <code>display: block</code> display.
        A block button will however go 100% of its parent's width.
        In the example, the button's containing content element also
        has <a>padding</a> applied, so there is some breathing room between
        the edge of the device and the buttons.
