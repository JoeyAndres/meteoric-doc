    <p>
        The List is a common and simple way of displaying... that's right, a list.
        This is a widely used interface across most current mobile OS's,
        and can include content ranging from basic text all the way to buttons,
        toggles, icons, and thumbnails.
    </p>

    <p>
        The list view is a very versatile and powerful component.
        List views support various interaction modes such as editing,
        swipe to edit, drag to reorder, and pull to refresh.

        For more power you can use Ionic's AngularJS directives.
        Check out the AngularJS list docs to get more detailed information.
